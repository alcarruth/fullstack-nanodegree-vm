Thank you for reviewing my tournament project.
I made a number of revisions in response the review:

	modified:   README.md
   - revised instructions to initialize database

	new file:   vagrant/tournament/reviewer_comments.txt
   - reviewer comments from first submission and my responses

	modified:   vagrant/tournament/tournament.py
   - uppercase SQL keywords
   - connect() returns (db, cursor) pair
   - calls to connect() changed accordingly

	modified:   vagrant/tournament/tournament.sql
   - added init commands:
      DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS tournament;
      CREATE DATABASE tournament;
      \c tournament
   - uppercase SQL keywords
   - added NOT NULL
   - added CHECK (winner <> loser)
   - added ON DELETE CASCADE clauses

	deleted:    vagrant/tournament/tournament_reset.sql
   - no longer needed since init code added to tournament.sql

The review also suggested changing my code to check for an even number
of players, but the code is already able to handle an odd number of
players so this is not necessary.

There was one suggestion I didn't understand regarding tournament.sql:

  """
  Overall, well done for the VIEW build-up to simplify the database
  query in tournament.py.  

  I believe you could do better in terms of avoiding the necessary
  VIEW like players since it can be directly retrieved from the
  table.
  """

QUESTION: 

  I don't understand what this last sentence means. 
  - Did you mean to say 'unnecessary'?
  - What do the words 'it' and 'table' refer to exactly?

Thanks again for the thoughtful comments!
